Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in,
 rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to determine the number of players who logged in on the day immediately following their initial login, and divide it by the number of total players.


SELECT 
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT b.player_id),
    2) AS fraction
FROM 
    (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
     FROM Activity
     GROUP BY player_id) b
JOIN 
    Activity a
  ON a.player_id = b.player_id
 AND a.event_date = DATE_ADD(b.first_login, INTERVAL 1 DAY);

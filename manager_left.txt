Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
WHERE e.salary < 30000
  AND m.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY e.employee_id;


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_id
from employees
where  salary<30000 and manager_id not in (select employee_id from employees)

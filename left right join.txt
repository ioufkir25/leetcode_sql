Write a solution to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

The employee's name is missing, or
The employee's salary is missing.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e.employee_id
from employees as e left join salaries as s on e.employee_id=s.employee_id
where s.employee_id is null
union
select sa.employee_id
from salaries as sa left join employees as em on em.employee_id=sa.employee_id
where em.employee_id is null
